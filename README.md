We have established this repository to serve as a comprehensive directory for resources related to the MCP, including items such as prompts, servers, and innovative ideas, all specifically tailored to the context of Swift application development. Our goal is to provide a centralized location where developers can access and contribute to a growing collection of materials that enhance the use of MCP in building better Swift apps faster.

## Servers

- [r-huijts/xcode-mcp-server](https://github.com/r-huijts/xcode-mcp-server): MCP Server implementation for Xcode integration
- [PolarVista/Xcode-mcp-server](https://github.com/PolarVista/Xcode-mcp-server): A Model Context Protocol server for building Xcode projects directly from LLM applications
- [ShenghaiWang/xcodebuild](https://github.com/ShenghaiWang/xcodebuild): MCP tool for building Xcode iOS workspace/project and feeding back error to LLMs. 
- [iMCP](https://github.com/loopwork-ai/iMCP): A macOS app that provides an MCP server to your Messages, Contacts, and more
- [cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP](https://github.com/cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP): A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Xcode-related tools for integration with AI assistants and other MCP clients. 

  
## SDKs
- [modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk): The official Swift SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients.
- [gsabran/mcp-swift-sdk](https://github.com/gsabran/mcp-swift-sdk): Swift implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing both client and server capabilities for integrating with LLM surfaces.

## Prompts üë©‚Äçüî¨

Include links here to Gists that demonstrate the prompts you‚Äôve utilized with Swift-related resources through the MCP server. These examples will help illustrate how to effectively leverage Swift‚Äôs ecosystem, showcasing practical applications and inspiring others to explore the capabilities of the MCP server in their own Swift projects.
